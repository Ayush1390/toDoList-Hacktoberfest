# toDoList-Hacktoberfest

## Project Description
The To-Do List Project is a simple task management application designed to help users keep track of their tasks, set priorities, and improve their productivity. This project provides an intuitive web-based platform where users can add, manage, and complete tasks efficiently.
This project is a basic webpage created using HTML, CSS and javascript. This is a purely front-end project, so no server or backend technology is required. You can easily customize the content, colors, and styles to match your preferences.
